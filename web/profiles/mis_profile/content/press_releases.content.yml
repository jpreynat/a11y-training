            <p>Schmidt manufactures millions of precision-engineered products that help to keep the world’s machines moving – from those that go into automotive clutch systems, to those in hybrid engines and the huge industrial bearings used in wind turbines. Through the agreement, Schmidt will tap Global Tech’s cloud-based Watson IoT technologies to help transform every aspect of its business from product development, through to manufacturing and its supply chain, sales and aftersales service. Advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence, cloud computing and the Internet of Things are driving increased connectivity and automation across the manufacturing industry. At the same time, engineering companies like Schmidt are pioneering the development of innovative ‘mechatronic’ solutions which combine mechanical, electronic and software capabilities into individual components and systems which have the ability to monitor, report and manage their own performance.</p>

            <p>Working with Global Tech, TBX is helping its clients tackle one of the most pressing IT challenges for enterprises; moving existing TBX ware workloads from on premises environments to the cloud without incurring the cost and risk associated with re-tooling operations, re-architecting applications and re-designing security policies. With over half a million enterprises running an estimated 50 million workloads, enterprises need fast, easy and cost effective ways to deploy and move VMware workloads between on-premises and cloud environments and across geographic boundaries. The Global Tech Cloud capability helps clients meet this growing demand by extending the global footprint of Vodafone’s Hosted Private Cloud service and helping establish a new hybrid cloud offering for enterprises. This new service is designed to help Vodafone enterprise customers reduce latency by locating applications closer to users while maintaining data within a security-rich global network.</p>
